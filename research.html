In difference-in-differences (DiD) settings with categorical outcomes, such as voting, occupation, or major choices, treatments often affect both total counts (e.g., turnout) and category shares (e.g., vote shares). Traditional linear DiD models can yield invalid counterfactuals in this context (e.g. negative values ) and  lacks compatibility with standard discrete choice models. I propose Compositional DiD (CoDiD), which identifies counterfactual totals and shares under a parallel growths assumption: absent treatment, each category‚Äôs size grows or shrinks at the same proportional rate in treated and control groups. I show that under a random utility model, this is equivalent to parallel trends in expected utilities, i.e., the change in average latent desirability for each alternative is identical across groups. Consequently, relative preferences (e.g., how individuals prefer Democrat vs. Republican) evolve in parallel, and counterfactual distributions follow parallel trajectories in the probability simplex. I extend CoDiD to (i) derive bounds under relaxed assumptions, (ii) accommodate staggered treatment timing, and (iii) construct a synthetic DiD analog. I illustrate the method‚Äôs empirical relevance through two applications: first, I examine how early voting reforms affect voter choice in U.S. presidential elections; second, I analyze how the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) affected the electricity mix in participating states.                </details>

                        In this paper, we propose a method for correcting sample selection bias when the outcome of interest is categorical, such as occupational choice, health status, or field of study. Classical approaches to sample selection rely on strong parametric distributional assumptions, which may be restrictive in practice. While the recent framework of Chernuzukov et al. (2023) offers a nonparametric identification using a local Gaussian representation (LGR) that holds for any bivariate joint distributions. This makes this approach limited to ordered discrete outcomes. We therefore extend it by developing a local representation that applies to joint probabilities, thereby eliminating the need to impose an artificial ordering on categories. Our representation decomposes each joint probability into marginal probabilities and a category-specific association parameter that captures how selection differentially affects each outcome. Under exclusion restrictions analogous to those in the LGR model, we establish nonparametric point identification of the latent categorical distribution. Building on this identification result, we introduce a semiparametric multinomial logit model with sample selection, propose a computationally tractable two-step estimator, and derive its asymptotic properties.

This paper provides a nonparametric framework for causal inference with categorical outcomes under binary treatment and binary instrument settings. We decompose the observed joint probability of outcomes and treatment into marginal probabilities of potential outcomes and treatment, and association parameters that capture selection bias due to unobserved heterogeneity. Under a novel identifying assumption \emph{association similarity}, which requires the dependence between unobserved factors and potential outcomes to be invariant across treatment states, we achieve point identification of the full distribution of potential outcomes. Recognizing that this assumption may be strong in some contexts, we propose two weaker alternatives: monotonic association, which restricts the direction of selection heterogeneity, and bounded association, which constrains its magnitude. These relaxed assumptions deliver sharp partial identification bounds that nest point identification as a special case and facilitate transparent sensitivity analysis. We illustrate the framework in an empirical application, estimating the causal effect of private health insurance on health outcomes.                    </span>

                        This paper addresses the critical issue of sample selection bias in cross-country comparisons based on international assessments such as the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Although PISA is widely used to benchmark educational performance across countries, it samples only students who remain enrolled in school at age 15. This introduces survival bias, particularly in countries with high dropout rates, potentially leading to distorted comparisons. To correct for this bias, I develop a simple adjustment of the classical Heckman selection model tailored to settings with fully truncated outcome data. My approach exploits the joint normality of latent errors and leverages information on the selection rate, allowing identification of the counterfactual mean outcome for the full population of 15-year-olds. Applying this method to PISA 2018 data, I show that adjusting for selection bias results in substantial changes in country rankings based on average performance. These results highlight the importance of accounting for non-random sample selection to ensure accurate and policy-relevant international comparisons of educational outcomes.
