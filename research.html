                Compositional Difference-in-Differences for categorical outcomes

                <strong>Abstract:</strong> In a DiD setting with categorical outcomes, we often care about treatment effects on both quantities and shares (i.e., outcome probabilities). But imposing linear parallel trends on either can be problematic: it leads to scale dependence, may produce negative counterfactuals, and imposes restrictions on choice behavior that do not align with standard discrete choice theory. We introduce Compositional Difference-in-Differences (CoDiD), a non-linear method, which identifies the counterfactual categorical quantities (hence the total quantity and the probability distribution) under a parallel curves assumption: absent treatment, each categoryâ€™s absolute size would proportionally grow or decline similarly in both groups. We show that, under a random utility model, this assumption implies that relative preferences across any pair of categories, captured by log-odds, would evolve similarly over time in the absence of treatment for both groups. Analytically, it also means that category shares would be reallocated similarly across treated and control units had the treatment not occurred. Another implication is geometric: the assumption implies that the probability mass functions of both groups follow parallel trajectories in the probability simplex under Aitchison geometry. We extend CoDiD to (i) derive bounds under relaxed versions of our assumption, (ii) accommodate staggered adoption, and (iii) develop a synthetic CoDiD approach. We illustrate the method's utility through two empirical applications: one on how early voting reforms can cause a change in voter choice in US presidential elections, and another on how the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative affected the composition of electricity generation from sources like gas, coal, nuclear, and renewables.

                Correcting sample selection bias with categorical outcomes
            </h2>
            <p class="card-abstract">
                <strong>Abstract:</strong> In this paper, we propose a method for correcting sample selection bias when the outcome of interest is categorical, such as occupational choice, health status, or field of study. Classical approaches to sample selection rely on strong parametric distributional assumptions, which may be restrictive in practice. While the recent framework of Chernuzukov et al. (2023) offers a nonparametric identification using a local Gaussian representation (LGR) that holds for any bivariate joint distributions. This makes this approach limited to ordered discrete outcomes. We therefore extend it by developing a local representation that applies to joint probabilities, thereby eliminating the need to impose an artificial ordering on categories. Our representation decomposes each joint probability into marginal probabilities and a category-specific association parameter that captures how selection differentially affects each outcome. Under exclusion restrictions analogous to those in the LGR model, we establish nonparametric point identification of the latent categorical distribution. Building on this identification result, we introduce a semiparametric multinomial logit model with sample selection, propose a computationally tractable two-step estimator, and derive its asymptotic properties. This framework significantly broadens the set of tools available for analyzing selection in categorical and other discrete outcomes, offering substantial relevance for empirical work across applied economics.

                Identifying treatment effects on categorical outcomes in IV models
            </h2>
            <p class="card-abstract">
                <strong>Abstract:</strong> We develop an instrumental variable framework for identifying the distributions of potential outcomes when the outcome is categorical. Our approach is based on a local representation of the joint probability of potential outcomes and the unobserved factors that drive treatment assignment. This representation motivates a new identifying assumption, so-called <em>association similarity</em>, stating that the local association between potential outcomes and unobserved heterogeneity remains stable across treatment states. Under this assumption, we achieve point identification of treatment effects for categorical, multinomial, and unordered outcomes using only a binary instrument. The identification strategy is constructive, allowing for practical estimation and inference procedures. We then provide an empirical illustration where we estimate the effect of private health insurance on both physical and mental health.

                Correcting Sample Selection Bias in PISA Rankings
            </h2>
            <p class="card-abstract">
                <strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper addresses the critical issue of sample selection bias in cross-country comparisons based on international assessments such as the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Although PISA is widely used to benchmark educational performance across countries, it samples only students who remain enrolled in school at age 15. This introduces survival bias, particularly in countries with high dropout rates, potentially leading to distorted comparisons. To correct for this bias, I develop a simple adjustment of the classical Heckman selection model tailored to settings with fully truncated outcome data. My approach exploits the joint normality of latent errors and leverages information on the selection rate, allowing identification of the counterfactual mean outcome for the full population of 15-year-olds. Applying this method to PISA 2018 data, I show that adjusting for selection bias results in substantial changes in country rankings based on average performance. These results highlight the importance of accounting for non-random sample selection to ensure accurate and policy-relevant international comparisons of educational outcomes.
